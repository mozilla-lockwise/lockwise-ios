<h2 id="140-build-2908">1.4.0 (Build 2908)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2019-03-11</em></p>
<p>This is a big update and we hope you enjoy it! Here's are the two major changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We've improved the search experience to use newer iOS features to help keep it stable and working consistently (which means we now require you use iOS 11).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We added iPad support so you can browse your logins in a full-screen app. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop your usernames and passwords into websites and apps if you use multitasking mode (Split View, Slide Over).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A big "thanks" to all the contributors that helped along the way!</p>

<h2 id="140-build-2769">1.4.0 (Build 2769)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2019-01-08</em></p>
<p>We've improved the search experience (and coming soon: added iPad support)! This is a big update and we hope you enjoy it. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the search experience to leverage built-in iOS features to help keep it stable and working consistently (which means we now require iOS 11)</li>
</ul>
<p>A big "thanks" to all the contributors that helped along the way!</p>
<h2 id="133-build-2731">1.3.3 (Build 2731)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-12-19</em></p>
<p>We fixed more bugs and added some (hopefully) helpful icons to the item detail view. You should see some slight improvements but nothing major. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added icons to show that you can open the webpage and/or copy the username and password with one tap</li>
<li>We fully close the database so it can't crash in the background, this means you should see AutoFill work more reliably</li>
<li>If you don't have any saved logins in your Firefox Account and try to enable AutoFill, we gracefully stop trying to set that up for you (since there's nothing to set up yet!)</li>
<li>We also updated some underlying libraries to keep up with other fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>A big "thanks" to all the contributors that helped along the way!</p>
<h2 id="133-build-2717">1.3.3 (Build 2717)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-12-17</em></p>

<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to RxSwift, application services dependencies</li>
<li>Add Copy and Open icons to item detail screen</li>
<li>Properly close DB when app is backgrounded</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="132-build-2635">1.3.2 (Build 2635)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-11-03</em></p>
<p>We fixed more bugs! You should see some slight improvements but nothing major.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>

<li>Login list scrolls to top after changing the sort order</li>
<li>AutoFill Instructions now looks better on smaller screens</li>

<p><em>Date: 2018-10-10</em></p>
<p>We fixed some bugs! The big ones are related to "Disconnecting" your Firefox Account (signing out) and the new AutoFill feature.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you "Disconnect" your Firefox Account then sign in again, you won't get stuck seeing the “No matching entries” error message</li>
<li>We also made it so if you sign in with a different account, you don't accidentally see the items from the first account</li>
<li>The app now presents Touch ID or Face ID upon app launch so you don't have to to do an extra tap to unlock</li>
<li>Additional steps are taken to not display multiple overlays at one time so it's clear what's been copied</li>
<li>Help text was added to the credential search when using AutoFill so you know exactly what to do</li>
<li>Instructions on how to setup AutoFill for iOS 12 users was added to onboarding and in the Settings screen</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Date: 2018-08-27</em></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: YOU MAY EXPERIENCE A CRASH!</strong> We're aware of an issue when you open the app it immediately crashes (and are working to gather more data and fix it). If this does happen, please re-open the app and continue testing everything else from there. Thank you!</p>
<p>It's been a month since our launch and we've been working hard to replace the old way of logging in with Firefox Accounts and fixing some bugs. For new users, they'll encounter a smoother and clearer experience. For existing users with the app already installed, you'll just need to sign in once again.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced the OAuth login flow to replace the "old" way of signing in</li>
<li>Added a "migration path" so users with the app sign back in and store data properly</li>
<li>The app clears your local storage and cache when you disconnect your account</li>
<li>You can now "pull to refresh" to force a sync when looking at an empty list</li>
<li>We fixed some alignment bugs for iPhone SEs running iOS 10</li>
<li>The autolock feature has been hardened as to when and how it locks the app</li>
<li>The app no longer dynamically adjusts the navigation bar sizes so it can be usable</li>
<li>If you type a very long search term you can "Cancel" and clear it as expected now</li>
<li>We improved the small arrows next to links</li>
<li>You can now "Ask a Question" from the settings screen to contact us directly</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to all our open source contributors that helped make this release possible.</p>

<h2 id="111-build-1717">1.1.1 (Build 1717)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-07-26</em></p>
<p>It's been two weeks since our initial public launch, and one week since we opened up to all countries. Thanks to everyone's feedback we have some minor changes and bug fixes for you in this update.</p>
<p>We made some changes to autolocking and want your help testing it! Please let us know if you find anything unexpected.</p>
<p>We also added Klar as a browser option instead of Focus, when available. Can all you German users with Klar installed please make sure it works OK?</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The autolock timer pauses when on a webpage so it doesn't lock when submitting feedback or reading FAQs</li>
<li>Updated the app icon to an improved version</li>
<li>You can pick Klar as your preferred browser (instead of Focus) if its available on your device</li>
<li>We added the app version to the settings screen and feedback survey so we can know what you're running</li>
<li>Fixed a visual bug on the "Preferred Browser" table</li>
<li>Added ability to "Lock Now" for users without a device passcode set</li>
<li>Added more autolock timer options: 15 and 30 minutes</li>
<li>Fixed a Firefox Account bug related to server configuration</li>
<li>Fixed it so you return to the "Confirm Your Email" state and screen even if your app fully quits instead of starting everything over</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note: we intentionally skipped from version 1.0 all the way to 1.1.1 for various reasons.</p>

<p><em>Date: 2018-07-18</em></p>
<p>We made some changes to autolocking and want your help testing it! Please let us know if you find anything unexpected.</p>
<p>We also added Klar as a browser option instead of Focus, when available. Can all you German users with Klar installed please make sure it works OK?</p>
<p>We also show the app version number in the settings screen and add it the feedback survey so folks can easily tell us which version of the app they're using.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added more autolock timer options: 15 and 30 minutes</li>
<li>The autolock timer now also pauses when viewing a webpage so it doesn't lock when submitting feedback or reading FAQs</li>
<li>You can pick Klar as your preferred browser (instead of Focus) if its available on your device</li>
<li>Updated the app icon to an improved version</li>
</ul>
