More information and many marble diagrams can be found in the ReactiveX documentation . The rest of this document relies on a basic understanding of the reader of the ReactiveX-style Observer implementation. Their intro document is a good starting point . Flux Architecture Pattern In short, Flux architecture design maintains a unidirectional data flow, in which a global Dispatcher receives Actions & dispatches them to appropriate Stores. The Stores, in turn, process data & provide the source of truth for the Views. As users interact with the Views, any updates are made via a dispatched Action and the cycle begins again. See this flux architecture writeup for more details on the original Flux architecture scheme. Lockbox implements a modified version of the described architecture (LockFlux), keeping in mind that the original implementation ignores asynchronous work. The key difference is in the implementation of an ActionHandler class. The ActionHandler s in some cases are a simple pass-through class for the dispatcher, but in others do some background work before dispatching the Action . Memory Management The six major components of this architecture ( View , Presenter , Store , Dispatcher , ActionHandler , and Action ) have distinct lifecycle management based on their functions. View / Presenter pairs are allocated and de-allocated as views get displayed or hidden in turn. Store s, ActionHandler s, and the Dispatcher are global singleton objects, meaning that they get lazy-loaded by the application as their shared members get accessed by the Presenter s for view configuration or dispatching. Action s get deallocated as soon as they reach the end observer for their intended function. View/Presenter All views are bound to a presenter[ 1 ]. In this separation, the presenter is responsible for all business logic, and the view is abstracted to a simple protocol. The view is responsible for UIKit-specific configuration and passing user input to its presenter for handling. This allows any complex view-related configuration to be abstracted when dealing with business logic changes, and vice versa. Presenters should never import UIKit in this separation of concerns. The View component of these view-presenter pairs maintains a strong reference to its Presenter , while the Presenter maintains a weak reference to the view to avoid retain cycles under ARC . Action Actions are tiny struct s or enum s that contain declarative language about either the triggering user action or the update request for a given Store . Dispatcher The dispatcher class is the simplest in the application; it provides an Action -accepting method as a wrapper for the PublishSubject<Action> that publishes all dispatched actions to interested Stores : class Dispatcher { static let shared = Dispatcher() private let storeDispatchSubject = PublishSubject<Action>() open var register: Observable<Action> { return self.storeDispatchSubject.asObservable() } open func dispatch(action: Action) { self.storeDispatchSubject.onNext(action) } } Store Stores provide an opaque wrapper around system storage or simple Replay- /Publish- Subject s for the purposes of data access and view configuration. View Routing The special case in this scenario is view routing. To handle the view-changing component of the architecture, there is a RouteStore observed by a RootPresenter that rides along on the back of a RootView . This \u201ccontaining\u201d view will never be displayed to the user; rather, it will perform the role of listening for navigation-specific Action s & performing the necessary top-level navigation stack swapping or navigation stack manipulation. Routing logic lives entirely separately from individual view configuration logic, allowing for modular view manipulation and easy testing. Example To fully understand the concept, it's useful to trace one user action through its lifecycle of use in the app. Following is a simplified description of how the filter field (or search box) on the main item list screen works. When a user enters text into the search field, the textfield binding[ 2 ] on the ItemListView emits an event to an observer on the ItemListPresenter . The ItemListPresenter dispatches a ItemListFilterAction , which is a simple struct with one property - filteringText: String . The struct does a round trip through the ItemListDisplayActionHandler , Dispatcher , and ItemListDisplayStore before getting combined with the most recent list of items back in the ItemListPresenter . This combined Observable stream with both the text and the items filters the list of items and maps the filtered list into individual cell configurations. The view, on receiving the updated / filtered list, re-renders the list of items to only show the ones that the user is searching for. There are a few other listeners for ItemListFilterAction s; for example, the Observable bound to the isHidden property of the Cancel button in the search bar maps the ItemListFilterAction with a simple !isEmpty check -- if the ItemListFilterAction.filteringText is empty, the cancel button is hidden, and if not, it's displayed. While it may seem like a lot of work to make the roundtrip with the Dispatcher , Current ActionHandler technical debt / area for improvement In the current LockFlux implementation, there is a discrepancy in the ways that asynchronous work is done. In some cases, async work is done behind the scenes at the Store level, and in others, as part of the pass-through setup between ActionHandler s and the Dispatcher . Ideally, we would get rid of the ActionHandler concept altogether, and Presenter s would construct and dispatch Action s directly to the Dispatcher . This will simplify tests and the architecture quite a bit.

It will be updated periodically to reflect all new and planned data collection. Analysis Data collection is done solely for the purpose of product development, improvement and maintenance. We will analyze the data described in this doc primarily with the purpose of (dis)confirming the following hypothesis: If Firefox users have access to their browser-saved passwords, outside of the mobile browser, then they will use those passwords to log into accounts (both in mobile browsers and in apps). We will know this to be true when copy credentials (username or password) is the most frequent action taken in the app. Note that because the first version of the app will not allow for \"auto-filling\" of credentials, the copy events (and to a lesser extent, the password reveal events) are the best signal we have that users are gaining the intended value from the app. In service to validating the above hypothesis, we plan on answering these specific questions, given the data we plan to collect (see List of Proposed Events ): Note that when referring to copying of \"credentials\", we mean copying of either usernames or passwords. Are users using Lockbox to retrieve credentials? For different intervals of time (e.g. day, week, month), what is: The average rate with which a user copies a credential or reveals a password The distribution of above rates across all users Pending the implementation of a share sheet, how often do users access Lockbox via a mobile browser? Out of all the times a credential was copied, how often was it a result of tap on the share sheet? This will help us understand whether users are primarily accessing credentials for use in a browser or with third party apps. Once downloaded, do users continue to use the app? (i.e., how well are they retained?) We will count a user as retained in a given time interval if they perform one of the following actions: Display the credential list Tap a credential in the credential list Copy a credential to the clipboard Reveal a password Tap the URI associated with a credential (to open it in an app or browser) Since they can be performed automatically, we will not count a user as retained if they only perform the following actions (in absence of any in the list above): Unlock their credentials Sync their credentials from the Firefox desktop browser Does requiring a Firefox Account constitute a roadblock to adoption? What proportion of new Lockbox users are pre-existing Firefox Account users? What proportion of users start the Account sign-in process but never complete it? Does adoption of Lockbox lead to adoption of Firefox Mobile browsers (e.g. Focus)? Do users set the default browser in Lockbox to be a Firefox-related browser? In addition to answering the above questions that directly concern actions in the app, we will also be analyzing telemetry emitted from the password manager that exists in the the Firefox desktop browser. These analyses will primarily examine whether users of Lockbox start active curation of their credentials in the desktop browser (Lockbox users will not be able to edit credentials directly from the app). Collection Data will be collected using this library: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/telemetry-ios/ We plan to submit two ping types. First is the \"core ping\", which contains information about the iOS version, architecture, etc of the device lockbox has been installed on: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/core-ping.html The second is the \"focus event ping\" which allows us to record event telemetry: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios/wiki/Event-Tracking-with-Mozilla%27s-Telemetry-Service The ping types are defined in lockbox-ios/Common/AppDelegate.swift . Scheduling of ping transmission is done in the same file. Every event must contain category , method and object fields, and may optionally contain value and extra fields as well. Possible values for the former three fields are defined in lockbox-ios/TelemetryIntegration.swift Events related to specific items should have an item id in the extra field where possible. Here's an example of (something like) the swift code needed to record the event that fires when an item in the entry list is tapped: Telemetry.default.recordEvent( category: TelemetryEventCategory.action, method: TelemetryEventMethod.tap, object: TelemetryEventObject.entryList, value: nil, extras: [\"itemid\" : itemid] ) Finally, the appName metadata sent with each ping should always be 'Lockbox'.
